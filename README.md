# Mathematics in Lean for PDEs

This repository contains Lean 4.1 code for the mathematics in the book by ``Partial Differential Equations'' by Evans. The code is written in the Lean theorem prover, which is a proof assistant based on dependent type theory. 

 I wrote only {Transport.lean}, {LinearDifferentialOperator.lean}, and {test_pde.lean}, and did not edit or write any of the other Lean files. All of this Lean code was written in November 2024.
